Practical Algebraic Calculus Proof Checker
=================================================

To compile use `./configure.sh` and then `make`.
Furthermore, you need to have installed `gmp` to run `Pacheck`.

For further information we refer to the paper:

Daniela Kaufmann, Mathias Fleury,  Armin Biere. 
 [`The PAC Checkers, Pacheck and Past√®que.`](http://fmv.jku.at/papers/KaufmannFleuryBiere-FMCAD20.pdf)  
In Proc. Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD) 2020, pages 264-269, TU Wien Academic Press 2020, 


Usage: 
----------------------------------
`./pacheck [ <option> ... ]  [ <input> <proof>] [<target>]`

where `<option>` is one of the following

  `-h | --help            print this command line option summary and exit`  

  `-s | --no-target       only check inferences but not that proof generates target`  

  `-v | --verbose         get verbose output on number of checked inferences (every 500 rules)`  

  `-e | --use-exponents   turn off implicit reduction of exponents`  

  `-i | --no-indices      turn off usage of indices`   

  `-d | --no-delete       ignore delete rules`  

  `--print        print polynomials in failing checks for better diagnosis`  

  `--sparse       use spaces to make printed polynomials easier to read`  

The `<input>` argument should point to a file with the
original set of polynomials and <proof> is a path to a proof file
interpreted as a sequence of inferences in the polynomial calculus.
The tool checks that all inferences in the sequence are correct.

The `<target>` is optional. Ommiting this file has the same effect as choosing option `-s`
It should point to a file with a single polynomial which
should be generated by the proof.
The exit code is zero if and only if all checks succeed.

Example: 
----------------------------------
Running `./pacheck examples/ex1.input examples/ex1.proof examples/ex1.target` yields
